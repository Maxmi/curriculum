| Term       | Explanation |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| git        | A free, open-source version control system which you can use with your command line to create local repositories and branches. It also allows you to save and edit changes to files in that repository while tracking the version history. For more information see: [Git Basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)|
| Github     | A web-based application that lets you store git repositories and provides tools to collaborate with a team. |
| repository | A repository is a directory that is being tracked by git via adding and committing changes to files in that directory. |
| commit     | A commit is any change to a file or set of files that you have saved. When you save your changes by using `git commit` you create a unique ID (a SHA) that lets you keep record of your changes. Commits have a date, author, and usually a brief commit message describing what has changed. |
| branch     | A branch is a parallel version of a repository that you can make changes to that won't affect the primary or `master` branch. Once you've made all the changes you need in your branch, you can merge it into the `master` branch to publish your changes. |
| remote     | The term remote refers to the copy of your repository that is online on Github |
| local      | The term local refers to the copy of your repository that you have on your local machine. |
